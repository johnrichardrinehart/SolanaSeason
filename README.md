# SolanaSeason

## What

We're going to build a data visualisation tool built on top of [Solana](solana.com) (a proof-of-history blockchain) and [Project Serum](https://projectserum.com/) (a DeFi exchange built using the Solana blockchain).

The idea is something like:
1. Users define an SQL query (using a web interface) over the data (that we make available to them)
1. Users select how to take the return rows and columns and represent those using charts
2. Users share charts with the community (free) or make them privately (public)

This is effectively a clone of [Dune Analytics](https://duneanalytics.com/) which was founded in 2019, received 2 million in seed funding, and is looking to hire 5 people in addition to the 2 that run that operation, currently.

Some of their code [is public](https://github.com/duneanalytics), so we might as well fork what we can.

Maybe, but not definitely, Dune Analytics is self-hosting [Redash](http://github.com/getredash/redash.git) - the [cororate site](https://redash.io/) offers subscriptions and a managed service.

## Who

1. John Rinehart
* Project coordinator
* Infrastructure manager (bill payer)
* Website/domain manager
* Redash setter-upper

2. Justin Restivo
* Core blockchain data (from Solana)

3. Kunal Khamar
* Project Serum DeFi data

## How

We'll use GitHub issues to track features and responsibilities.
We'll use a private Discord server for communication.
We'll divide the responsibility for the project into 3 parts (see above).
We'll have ad-hoc meetings as necessary.

## When

Until [June 7, 2021](https://solana.com/solanaszn).


## Why

It would be fun to build something and there's a ton of prize money. Maybe, maybe if we get some money out of this we can consider expanding.
